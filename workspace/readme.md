# Workspace Folder

Hello!

Welcome to GraphQL Gateway API tutorial.

This is your working folder `workspace`. Content of the folder `workspace` is excluded from git repository. Whatever you will create inside this folder will stay on your local machine only.

### Phase 1: List of Tags

In first phase you will build a Hot Chocolate Gateway API connected to REST WebApi to manipulate list of Tags stored in MongoDB. You will learn how to resolve Query, Mutation and use Subscription.

1. Create WebAPI service using MongoDB using `/rest-service` tutorial.
2. Create GraphQL Gateway API using Hot Chocolate server using `/gw-service/readme-phase1.md` tutorial.
3. Frontend project is ready to use from `/web-client-list` folder.

### Phase 2: Friend Recommendations

Once Tags collection is working, now you will stitch your Gateway API schema with the schema of Apollo GraphQL server connected to Neo4j database.

1. Create GraphQL server connected to Neo4j using `/gql-service` tutorial.
2. Update GraphQL Gateway API using Hot Chocolate server using `/gw-service/readme-phase2.md` tutorial.
3. Frontend project is ready to use from `/web-client-likes` folder.
